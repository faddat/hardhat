## Context

I've known that the spammy attack can be enhanced by maybe 100x.  This does that, and it also works with https://github.com/notional-labs/rpc-crawler.

spammy-go takes the output of the rpc-crawler, which is open RPCs.  

Then, spammy-go will blast 30kb IBC transfers into every rpc at once at top speed.  

Specificially this exploits:

* banana king
* p2p-storms

## Bonus content

* All of my emails with the interchain foundation
* reports to the interchain foundation about this issue dating back to 2021
